### **Problem Statement Section**

**Section Title**: The Mobility Crisis in Kenya

**Opening Statement**: In Kenya, mobility shouldn't determine destiny. Yet for 1.16 million citizens with mobility disabilities, physical barriers become life-limiting obstacles to education, employment, and safety.

**Key Statistics**:

* **1.16 million** Kenyans face daily mobility barriers  
* **66%** live in rural areas with inadequate infrastructure  
* **10.45%** unemployment rate among PWDs vs 5.2% national average  
* **83%** of women with disabilities face lifetime sexual abuse risk  
* **Only 3.1%** of public sector jobs meet the 5% PWD quota

**Closing Statement**: These aren't just numbers—they represent dreams deferred, potential unrealized, and communities divided by barriers that technology can remove.

## **ABOUT TUSONGE PAGE**

### **Our Mission Section**

**Vision Statement**: A Kenya where mobility barriers don't limit human potential.

**Mission**: We develop affordable, sustainable wheelchair mobility solutions through innovative engineering, community partnership, and environmental responsibility.

**Our Values**:

* **Innovation**: Engineering solutions that didn't exist before  
* **Dignity**: Respecting the autonomy and expertise of disabled communities  
* **Sustainability**: Building circular economy solutions from e-waste  
* **Community**: Co-creating with users, not for them  
* **Accessibility**: Making independence affordable and available

### **Why Tusonge Matters Section**

**The Gap We Fill**: Current wheelchair attachments cost $6,626-$7,000—completely inaccessible to most Kenyans. International solutions aren't designed for our terrain, climate, or economic realities.

**Our Approach**: We manufacture locally, use recycled materials, and price for accessibility. Our target price of $250-400 makes independence achievable for Kenya's disability community.

**Beyond Mobility**: Tusonge addresses interconnected challenges—gender-based violence prevention, economic empowerment, environmental sustainability, and household energy access—through integrated design thinking.

### **Leadership Team Section**

**Oliver Wainaina, Founder & CEO** Engineering background with proven track record in social innovation. Creator of Sauti Salama, a GBV reporting platform that gained international recognition. Combines technical expertise with deep understanding of systemic barriers facing vulnerable communities.

**Advisory Structure** \[In Development\]:

* Disability rights advocates from UDPK and NFDK  
* Technical experts in assistive technology  
* Healthcare professionals and rehabilitation specialists  
* Business and finance professionals  
* Legal and regulatory experts

## **THE CHALLENGE PAGE**

### **Kenya's Mobility Crisis Section**

**The Scale of Need**: Kenya's 4.44 million citizens with disabilities represent 10% of our population. Of these, 1.16 million face daily mobility challenges that limit access to education, employment, healthcare, and social participation.

**Geographic Disparities**: 66% of disabled people live in rural areas where infrastructure barriers are most severe. Unpaved roads, absent ramps, and inaccessible buildings create isolation that compounds other forms of discrimination.

**The Wheelchair Gap**: Kenya needs 100,000 new wheelchairs annually, but current supply chains and financing models leave most needs unmet. Even when wheelchairs are available, they often break down on rough terrain without repair support.

### **Infrastructure Barriers Section**

**Built Environment Challenges**:

* Public buildings lack accessible entrances and facilities  
* Matatu stations and public transport remain largely inaccessible  
* Rough roads and absent sidewalks make manual wheelchair navigation exhausting  
* Schools and workplaces lack basic accessibility modifications

**Transportation Crisis**: Public transport systems don't accommodate wheelchairs, forcing expensive private solutions or complete isolation from opportunities in other areas.

### **Intersectional Vulnerabilities Section**

**Women with Disabilities Face Compounded Risks**: Of Kenya's 523,883 women with disabilities, many face multiple, intersecting forms of discrimination that create heightened vulnerability to violence and economic exploitation.

**Gender-Based Violence Statistics**:

* **83%** of women with disabilities experience sexual abuse in their lifetime  
* **40-68%** of girls with disabilities face abuse before age 18  
* **59%** of incidents go unreported due to accessibility barriers

**Economic Vulnerability**: Limited mobility increases dependency on others for transportation, creating opportunities for economic control and exploitation. Only 41% of women with disabilities participate in the labor force compared to higher rates for men.

### **Environmental Challenge Section**

**Kenya's E-Waste Crisis**: In 2024, Kenya generated 53,559 metric tonnes of electronic waste, with only 5-15% formally recycled. The remainder creates soil and water contamination while valuable lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements end up in landfills.

**The Circular Opportunity**: Laptops, power banks, and electric lamps contain high-quality lithium-ion cells perfect for wheelchair battery packs. By recycling these components, we reduce manufacturing costs by up to 35% while addressing environmental challenges.

## **IMPACT & THEORY OF CHANGE PAGE**

### **Our Theory of Change Section**

**Core Belief**: Mobility is fundamental to human dignity and social participation. When we remove physical barriers, we unlock human potential across multiple dimensions of life.

**Four Interconnected Nexuses**: Our approach recognizes that mobility challenges intersect with environmental, economic, gender, and energy issues. Solving mobility creates positive cascading effects across all these areas.

### **Nexus 1: Environmental Conservation Section**

**E-Waste Impact**: Kenya's e-waste crisis offers an opportunity for sustainable innovation. By recycling 500-1,000 tonnes of electronic waste into battery components, we:

* **Reduce CO2 emissions** by 0.5-1 ton per wheelchair (avoiding new mining)  
* **Create green jobs** in recycling and assembly (500-1,000 positions)  
* **Prevent toxic contamination** of soil and water systems  
* **Support circular economy** development in Kenya

**Wheelchair Retention**: Using existing wheelchairs avoids manufacturing emissions from 100,000 annual replacements, supporting Kenya's 32% emissions reduction goal by 2030\.

### **Nexus 2: Economic Empowerment Section**

**Employment Barriers Removed**: Physical mobility directly enables economic mobility. Our devices target:

* **40% increase** in employment among users  
* **Workplace accessibility** through reliable transportation  
* **Skills training access** by reaching education centers  
* **Entrepreneurship opportunities** through enhanced mobility range

**Current Gap**: PWD unemployment at 10.45% vs 5.2% national average represents lost economic productivity. Only 3.1% of public sector jobs meet PWD quotas.

**Economic Multiplier Effect**: Each employed PWD supports average 3-4 family members, amplifying economic impact across communities.

### **Nexus 3: Gender Equality & GBV Prevention Section**

**Mobility as Protection**: For women with disabilities, independent mobility serves as a protective factor against gender-based violence:

**Risk Reduction Mechanisms**:

* **Quick escape capability** from dangerous situations  
* **Economic independence** reducing dependency vulnerability  
* **Service access** to police, hospitals, and support organizations  
* **Social network expansion** providing community support

**Current Vulnerabilities**:

* 83% of women with disabilities face lifetime sexual abuse  
* 40-68% of girls experience abuse before age 18  
* Economic dependency increases tolerance of abuse  
* 59% of incidents go unreported due to access barriers

**Empowerment Strategy**: Independent mobility enables women to access employment, education, and leadership opportunities that build economic security and social capital.

### **Nexus 4: Household Resilience Section**

**Multipurpose Energy Solutions**: Our battery packs serve dual purposes—powering mobility devices and providing household energy:

**Household Benefits**:

* **Cost savings** of KES 5,000-10,000 annually per household  
* **Energy security** during power outages  
* **Income generation** through phone charging services  
* **Study enablement** with reliable lighting for children

**Rural Impact**: In areas where 25% lack reliable electricity access, detachable batteries provide energy equity and support micro-enterprise development.

### **Measurable Outcomes Section**

**3-Year Impact Targets**:

**Quantitative Metrics**:

* 6,000 wheelchair users with enhanced mobility  
* 60% of users reporting increased independence
